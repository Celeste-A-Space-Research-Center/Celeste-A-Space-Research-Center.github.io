    <p><b>G. Narayanamma Institute of Technology and Science (GNITS)</b> stands as a distinguished research institution
      dedicated to advancing women's engineering education and pushing the boundaries of scientific exploration. Founded
      in 1997 by the late Sri G. Pulla Reddy, GNITS holds the distinction of being the second women's engineering
      institute established in India, with a rich legacy of academic excellence and innovation. GNITS was established in
      Shaikpet, Hyderabad.<br><br>

      <b>Celeste: A Space Research Centre</b>, officially inaugurated on February 23rd, 2024, under the auspices of
      esteemed dignitaries Dr. K. Ramesh Reddy, Principal of GNITS, and Dr. M. Seetha, Dean of Research and Development,
      marks a significant step in GNITS's commitment to advancing space exploration. This momentous occasion coincided
      with the historic revelation at the University of Southampton concerning the measurement of gravity at a
      microscopic level, symbolizing the dawn of a new era in space exploration at GNITS. Operated by diligent student
      researchers under the guidance of esteemed faculty members Dr. Swapna Raghunath and Dr. Rajesh T, Celeste is
      dedicated to leveraging principles of computer science and electronics to propel advancements in astrophysics and
      space science.<br><br>

      Inspired by the remarkable achievements of our alumni, GNITS students are imbued with a profound sense of purpose
      and determination. They are driven not only by the desire to follow in the footsteps of these esteemed individuals
      but also by a shared vision of pushing the boundaries of knowledge and discovery. Motivated by the groundbreaking
      contributions of former graduates such as Ms. Bireddy Ramya, Scientist at the Physical Research Laboratory, ISRO,
      and Ms. Sai Veena, Scientist at the UR Rao Satellite Center, ISRO, who played pivotal roles in the success of the
      Chandrayaan 3 mission, GNITS students are propelled towards excellence in their pursuit of space research.<br>
      With access to state-of-the-art facilities and guidance from distinguished faculty members, GNITS students are
      equipped to embark on ambitious projects at Celeste: A Space Research Centre. Utilizing cutting-edge computational
      methodologies, they delve into the complexities of astrophysics and space science, leveraging their expertise in
      computer science and electronics. Their research endeavors aim not only to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos but
      also to make tangible contributions to disciplines such as metrology and astronomy.
